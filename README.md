# Programmable-DC-power-supply

Course Practice Project of Circuits and Analog Electronics

This paper is based on the project of Group 5 in the practical training course *Circuits and Analog Electronic Technology* at ******** College, ******* University. It focuses on the working principle of the programmable DC regulated power supply developed by our group, including circuit design and soldering, programming of each functional module, system integration testing, and final acceptance of results.

The project provides a novel solution for the design and implementation of a high-precision, low-power-consumption, low-power programmable DC regulated power supply by combining a linear regulator with a switching converter. This approach offers a new idea for the design and improvement of this project for future students. It is hoped that students who are assigned this project in the future can further refine and enhance it based on our research, and ultimately develop it into a qualified and practical product.

Except for the engineering schematic of the 220 V AC to 24 V DC output module, all materials involved in this project—including circuit schematics, PCB layout files, enclosure design, thesis documentation, and STM32 microcontroller code—will be organized and open-sourced on this platform.
